# Reactivation

A baseline for building react + redux web applications, with a simplistic webpack configuration that adds CSS Modules, automatic SVG sprites, an easy to configure mock rest api and image asset minification out of the box.

## Getting started

```sh
npx degit digital-engineers/reactivation my-swanky-project
cd my-swanky-project
npm install
```

## Debugging

## Building an optimized, deployable release

`npm run build`
